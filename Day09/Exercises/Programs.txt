Practice all programs in the examples section before solving exercise programs.

Programs:

1. ReverseNumbers: Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1.

2. SumOfNaturalNumbers : Write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural number.

3. Factorial : Write a program to find the factorial value of any number entered through the keyboard. 

4. PowerOf : Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. 
			 Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another. (
			 Do not use Java built-in method)

5. SumOfDigits : Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. 
				   For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 15.

6. ReverseDigits : Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. 
				   For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.

7. UseDoWhile : Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. 
				 The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again. 
				 If so, the loop should repeat; otherwise it should terminate. 

8. PrimeOrNot : Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. 
				It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number. 

9. HCF : Write a program to calculate HCF of Two given number.

10.SumOfEvenAndOddNumbers : Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.
						
                        	Stop reading input from user based on user choice (y/n) and use do-while.

11. CountOfPositiveAndNegative : Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered. 

12. FindLargeAndSmallNumber : Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

13. AmstrongNumbers :Write a program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500. 
					  If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number.
					  For example, 153  = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )

16. FibonacciSeries : Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
					  0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 24 ..... 
                      
17. Pattern# : Write a program to print following :

    i)
    
    **********
    **********
    **********
    **********
    
    ii)

       222
      33333
     4444444
    555555555
    
    vi)
    
        1
       212
      32123
     4321234
    543212345
