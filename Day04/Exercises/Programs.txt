Practice all programs in the examples section before solving exercise programs.


Assignment Operators:

1.MixedCalculationWithAO: Write a program to add 10 to the number 456 and then divide it by 3. 
			Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the final result
			(Note: solve this by using assignment operators).

Guess the output before writing program and then validate your answer.

2.  int z = 20;
    int y = 21;
    int x = 30;
 
    // Using Assignment Operators
    z += 5;
    y %= 4;
 
    // Using normal operation
    x = x -7;
 
    System.out.println("Value of z: " + z);
    System.out.println("Value of y: " + y);
    System.out.println("Value of x: " + x);

Relational Operators:

Guess the output before writing program and then validate your answer.

1.      float f = 75.0f;
        double d = 75.0;
        int i = 75;
        
        System.out.println("f and d are equal? - " + (f==d));
        System.out.println("f and i are equal? - " + (f==i));
        System.out.println("d and i are equal? - " + (d==i));

Logical Operators:
Guess the output before writing program and then validate your answer.

1.       int x = 5;
         System.out.println(x > 3 && x < 10);
         System.out.println(x > 3 || x < 10);
         System.out.println(!(x > 3 && x < 10));

2.       int a = 25, b = -11, c = 0;
         System.out.println((a<c && b<c) && (a>c && b>c));
         System.out.println((a>c && b<c) && (a<c && b>c));
         
         System.out.println((a<c && b<c) || (a>c && b>c));
         System.out.println((a>c && b<c) || (a<c && b>c));
         
         System.out.println((a<c || b<c) && (a>c || b>c));
         System.out.println((a>c || b<c) && (a<c || b>c));
         
         System.out.println((a<c || b<c) || (a>c || b>c));
         System.out.println((a>c || b<c) || (a<c || b>c));

Ternary Operator:

1. MinOfTwoNumbers: write a program to find the minimum of two integers(n1 = 32, n2 = 23) using ternary operator.
2. MinOfThreeNumbers: write a program to find the maximum of two integers(n1 = 5, n2 = 7, n3 = 3) using ternary operator.

Guess the output before writing program and then validate your answer.
3.       String name = "java";

         int marks = name == "java"?10:20;
         System.out.println("Marks=" + marks);
         
         marks = name == "Java"?10:20;
         System.out.println("Marks=" + marks);
