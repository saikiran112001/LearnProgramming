Practice all programs in the examples section before solving exercise programs.

Arrays 1-D:

1. AvgOfTenIntegers: Write a program to initialize 10 integer values from 11 to 20 and print Average of all integers.

2. FindElementIndex:  Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Again ask user to give a number. 
				 Now, print index of that number when is present in array otherwise -1.
					  Ex: arr = {67,23,43,24,56,76,54,25,87,95}
						I/P: value = 25   //Test Case 1
						O/P: 25 Index is 7
						I/P: value = 13  //Test Case 2
						O/P: 13 Index is -1

3. DuplicateValues: Take N integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Print the duplicate values in array.


4. CommonElements: Read 2 integer arrays from user and find and print the common elements.

5. SplitArray: Take an array of 10 elements. Split it into middle and store the elements in two dfferent arrays.
				Ex: INITIAL array :
				58	24	13	15	63	9	8	81	1	78
				
				After spliting :
				58	24	13	15	63
				9	8	81	1	78

6. SecondLargest: Take N integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Print the second largest element from an array.

7. SecondSmallest: Take N integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Print the second smallest element from an array.

8. PrintOddPosition: Take N integers from user and print the elements of an array present on odd position.

9. CompareIntArrays: Take 2 integer arrays from user and print if both arrays are same or not.

10. CompareBoolArrays: Take 2 boolean arrays from user and print if both arrays are same or not.

11. CompareFloatArrays: Take 2 float arrays from user and print if both arrays are same or not.

12. PrintSubArray: Read an integer array from user and start and end index values. Print the sub arrays using start and end index values.

13. PairsSum: Take N integers and sum value from user and find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number.
